Rothschild
====

Rothschild is a transaction generator tool for the Kaspa network.

## Usage

* After [installing kaspad](https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad#build-from-source), run the following command:

```bash
$ genkeypair --testnet
```

* Create a file with the same structure as [addresses_example.json](addresses_example.json) and replace `myPrivateKey`
  with the generated private key from `genkeypair`, and the addresses on `myAddress` and `spendAddresses` with the
  address that was generated by `genkeypair`.
* Send some KAS to that address.
* Run
  ```bash
  $ go run . -a <PATH_TO_ADDRESSES_FILE>
  ```
  This will generate transactions with 1 second interval. You can change the interval with the `-i` parameter:
  ```bash
  $ go run . -a <PATH_TO_ADDRESSES_FILE> -i=<INTERVAL_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS>
  ```
